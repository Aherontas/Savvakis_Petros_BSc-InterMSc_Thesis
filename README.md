My BSc-Integrated MSc Thesis about: 

**Design and Development of a Digital Twin of an Electric Vehicleâ€™s Batteries
**

The purpose of this thesis is the design and development of a digital twin for an electric vehicle's energy storage system, specifically using lithium-ion batteries.
Specifically, a system will be designed which will measure voltage, current and
temperature of the cells and the battery pack.
Upon taking the measurements, a decision will be made by the integrated system
for the optimal management of the charge and discharge of the batteries.
The data that will be collected will be stored and processed in the cloud, in which
a digital twin of the system will be created. In addition, we will be able to view
the data we have collected in a real time UI.
Finally, the digital battery management model will improve with the collection
and storage of data in the cloud and will upgrade over time the physical model.
